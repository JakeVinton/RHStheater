# RHStheatre

This will be a place for files relating to the RHS Magnet Communications Program studio can be stored.

We will be updating this file as much as possible before I graduate in 2024. I am aiming to share all of my knowladge here to help ensure future students can use this to trouble-shoot problems they have in the auditorium. Please feel free to email or text me if you have any questions.
